Human mental search: a new population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm

## Abstract
Population-based metaheuristic algorithms have become popular in recent years with them getting used in different fields such as business, medicine, and agriculture. The present paper proposes a simple but efficient population-based metaheuristic algorithm called Human Mental Search (HMS). HMS algorithm mimics the exploration strategies of the bid space in online auctions. The three leading steps of HMS algorithm are: (1) the mental search that explores the region around each solution based on Levy flight, (2) grouping that determines a promising region, and (3) moving the solutions toward the best strategy. To evaluate the efficiency of HMS algorithm, some test functions with different characteristics are studied. The results are compared with nine state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms. Moreover, some nonparametric statistical methods, including Wilcoxon signed rank test and Friedman test, are provided. The experimental results demonstrate that the HMS algorithm can present competitive results compared to other algorithms.
